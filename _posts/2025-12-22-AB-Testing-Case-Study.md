# AB Testing
AB testing to statistical randomized control trials is one of the most popular ways for business to test: 
new UX features, new version of a product or new version of an algorithm.

In AB testing, you have two groups of users and you give the current vesrion of the product to one group referred to as the
control group and the new improved version of the product to another group reffred to as the experimental group and your aim as 
a data scientist is to understand the effect of the changes in the product on the user experience. You want to be able to say 
if the new changes to the product has made it a better experinece for the users or not. In this way the bussiness can understand if
it is a good idea to implement the new change or just keep it as it is. or test new variations.

## AB testing steps:

1. **Hypothesis Desing**
At this point, all the stake holders decide what is being tested. What is the desired outcome and what KPI (key performance Indicator) we are going to influence. For example at this point we are deciding whether changing the color of a botom in the product page, is going to improve the engagment of the costumers.

2. **Test desing**
In this point we need to define the key primary metric for our test. This is the most important part of the test probably. The sucess metric is only one and we can not define more than one for a test as it is going to bias the results analysis. This metric can be for example the conversion rate. The subscription rate or so on ...
conversion rate = (number of conversion / total number of visitors) * 100

4. **Run AB test**
   
   - Resutls analysis
   - Draw conclution
